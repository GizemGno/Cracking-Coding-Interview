/**
 * 3.3 - Stack of Plates
 * Imagine a stack of plates, if the stack gts too high, it might topple
 * Therefore in real life, we would like to start a new stack when the previous
 * stack exceeds some threshold. Implement a data structure SetOfStacks. Should be composed
 * of several stacks and sould create a new stack once the previous exceeds
 * capacity. SetOfStacks.push() and SetOfStacks.pop() should behave identically to
 * a single stack
 * Follow Up
 * Implement a function popAt(int index) which performs a pop operation on a specific
 * sub-stack
