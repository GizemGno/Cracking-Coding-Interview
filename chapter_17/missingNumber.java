/** 
 * 17.4 - Missing Number
 * An array A contains all the integers from 0 to n, except for one number which is missing
 * We can't access an entire integer in A with a single operation
 * The elements of A are represented in binary, and the only operation we can use
 * to access them is "fetch the jth bit of A[i]"
 * which takes constant time
 * Write code to find the missing integer
